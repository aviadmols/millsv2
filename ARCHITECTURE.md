# Mills Subscriptions v2 — ARCHITECTURE (locked contract)

Changes to anything in this file require Aviad's explicit approval, recorded in §11 with a date.
Companion documents: `CLAUDE.md` (laws), `docs/SYSTEM-MAP.md` (v1 map + frozen HTTP contract §3),
`docs/REBUILD-PLAN.md` (phased plan).

## 1. System boundaries

- **This app owns:** customers, dogs, subscriptions, payment methods (PayMe buyer keys),
  payment ledger, activity timeline, product/media cache, quiz payloads, OTP auth, emails
  (admin-managed SMTP), admin panel.
- **Shopify owns:** products/variants (authoritative catalog + images), checkout, orders,
  order webhooks. Connected via a **real Shopify app** (§1b) — never a pasted admin token,
  never metaobjects/metafields.
- **PayMe owns:** card tokenization (Hosted Fields) and charging (`generate-sale` with
  buyer_key). Card data never touches this server.
- **019 owns:** SMS delivery for OTP (phase 2 of auth; email SMTP first).

## 1b. Shopify app integration (the "connect as an app" model)

Modeled on RECHARGE's OAuth layer + the engine's Sales-Channel extension (the only proven way
to make orders appear under the app's Channel column).

- **App type:** Partner-Dashboard app, **custom distribution** (single store, not App Store).
  Credentials: `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` / `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` (env). No `shpat_` tokens in env.
- **Install flow (port from RECHARGE `OAuthController` + `ShopInstaller`, single-store
  simplified):** `GET /shopify/install` → `admin/oauth/authorize` (scopes below, single-use
  state nonce, offline token) → `GET /shopify/callback` (HMAC fail-closed, state consumed once,
  code→token exchange) → store token `encrypted` in the single `shopify_connection` record →
  dispatch `RegisterShopifyWebhooksJob` + `ImportShopProductsJob`. `use_legacy_install_flow=true`;
  no App Bridge / embedded admin — Filament runs standalone.
- **Scopes:** `read_products, read_orders, write_orders, read_draft_orders, write_draft_orders,
  read_customers, write_customers`.
- **Webhooks (registered programmatically on install, idempotent):** `orders/paid`,
  `orders/create`, `orders/cancelled`, `app/uninstalled`, `products/create`, `products/update`,
  `products/delete`. Verification: fail-closed raw-body HMAC middleware (RECHARGE
  `VerifyShopifyWebhook` pattern); dedupe by `webhook_id`; respond 202 fast, process on queue.
- **Admin client:** single global `ShopifyAdminClient` (engine shape) with RECHARGE hygiene —
  pinned `api_version` (one place in `config/shopify.php`), 429/THROTTLED backoff,
  Link-header pagination.
- **Sales Channel attribution (Aviad requirement #8):** ship a **Sales Channel extension**
  (port of engine `extensions/payplus-installments-channel/`, renamed handle
  **`mills-subscriptions`**, Hebrew label), deployed with `shopify app deploy`; app registered
  as a Sales Channel in the Partner Dashboard. A `ShopifyOrderAttribution` helper is the ONLY
  source of order attribution: `source_name = 'mills-subscriptions'` (== channel handle) +
  fallback `note_attributes` (`mills_order_role`, `mills_subscription_id`) + tag
  `mills-subscriptions`. Every order-creation call site uses it.

## 1c. Product & media cache (Aviad requirement #7)

Local cache so hot paths (quiz recommendations, admin pickers, `/me subscription_products`,
emails) never call Shopify live. RECHARGE `ProductUpserter`/`ProductWebhookHandler` pattern.

- **Tables:** `products` (external_id unique, title, handle, status, tags json,
  **image_url** ← GraphQL `featuredImage.url` — Shopify CDN URL, no re-hosting) and
  `product_variants` (external_id, product_id FK, title, sku, price, position,
  **image_url** (variant image fallback→product), + Mills fields parsed from SKU as in v1:
  grams, pack_size, flavor_key).
- **Sync triggers:** install backfill job → `products/*` webhooks re-fetch canonical product →
  nightly full refresh (scheduler) → manual "Refresh products" button in admin.
  `products/delete` marks `status=unlisted` (never hard-delete — subscriptions reference
  variants).
- If a product gallery is ever needed: extend the GraphQL selection to `media(first:n)`;
  until then `featuredImage` only.

extensions/mills-subscriptions-channel/   Sales Channel extension (shopify.extension.toml)
lang/en/*.php + lang/he/*.php  (mirrored)
```

## 3. State machines (canonical — the only legal transitions)

**SubscriptionStatus** (internal; API edge maps ↔ v1 strings `active|pending|disable`):
```
pending   → active, cancelled
active    → paused, past_due, cancelled
paused    → active, cancelled
past_due  → active, cancelled
cancelled → (terminal)
```
Edge mapping: `disable` (v1) ⇄ `cancelled`. **Cancellation is ALWAYS immediate** (Aviad
decision): the transition executes at once, `next_charge_at` is cleared, a Timeline event is
written, and a cancellation email is sent. There is no end-of-period mode anywhere — not in the
portal, not in the admin, not in copy.

**LedgerStatus** (money truth):
```
pending         → succeeded, failed
failed          → retry_scheduled
retry_scheduled → succeeded, failed
succeeded       → refunded
refunded        → (terminal)
```

**PaymentState** (per subscription): `payme` (billable) | `needs_card_update` (iCount wall —
billing skips; `/me` reports `requires_card_update:true`; billing-affecting writes return 403
`icount_requires_card_update` exactly as v1).

## 4. Idempotency keys (deterministic, via IdempotencyKey class only)

```
recurring:{subscriptionId}:{cycleDate Y-m-d}     the daily recurring charge
retry:{ledgerId}:{attemptNumber}                 domain-scheduled retries
manual:{subscriptionId}:{adminId}:{Y-m-d}        admin "charge now"
```
`payment_ledger.idempotency_key` is UNIQUE. Four-layer wall: unique job → succeeded-precheck →
unique index → `lockForUpdate`.

## 5. Billing engine

- `mills:dispatch-due` every 5 min (scheduler service): `status=active AND payment_state=payme
  AND next_charge_at <= now()` — **window select with automatic catch-up** (no single-minute
  gate, no cache toggle). Chunked; one ChargeJob per subscription.
- ChargeOrchestrator order: lock → succeeded-precheck → payment-method precheck (fail closed →
  `needs_card_update` + event) → `Ledger::open(pending)` → PayMe charge → transition ledger →
  **[success side effects, each compensating, never unwinding money truth]:**
  1. **Create the Shopify order via `orderCreate`** with inline
     `transactions:[{kind:'sale', status:'success', gateway:'manual', source:'external'}]`
     (money already moved via PayMe) and **attribution via `ShopifyOrderAttribution`**
     (`source_name='mills-subscriptions'` ⇒ order shows under the app's Channel). This
     replaces v1's draft→complete billing path.
  2. Advance `next_charge_at += frequency_months`; clear dog add-ons.
  3. **Create the NEXT cycle's draft order** — kept solely as the "upcoming order" preview
     (`/me` exposes `draft_order_id`; frozen contract).
  4. Timeline event + charge-succeeded email.
- Failure backoff `[4,24,72]h` (config `billing.retry_backoff_hours`) via `next_retry_at`;
  exhausted → subscription `past_due` + notification.
- Kill switch: env `BILLING_KILL_SWITCH=1` stops dispatch (logged loudly). No other gates.
- Heartbeats: scheduler + worker every minute → observability page.

## 6. Auth

- **Storefront token (frozen v1 format):** `<customer_numeric_id>.<unix_ts>.<hmac_sha256_hex>`
  HMAC'd with `STOREFRONT_TOKEN_SECRET`; 24h max age; preview variant `pv.*` read-only. v2
  verifies identically; customer resolved from local DB.
- **OTP (new):** `POST /storefront/auth/otp/request {email}` → hashed 6-digit code, TTL 10 min,
  rate-limit 3/15min/destination; `POST /storefront/auth/otp/verify {email, code}` → mints the
  standard storefront token above. Channels: `email` (SMTP via admin-managed mail settings,
  phase 1), **`sms` via 019** (adapter `Sms019Sender` behind the `SmsSender` contract, config
  `services.sms_019.*` — implemented when Aviad provides credentials). Liquid-minted tokens
  remain valid in parallel until retired.
- **API secret:** `/api/*` + legacy surface keep `X-API-Secret` / Bearer == `API_SECRET`
  (same value as v1 at cutover). Webhooks use the app secret HMAC.
- **Admin:** Filament session auth (users table).

## 7. Data schema (summary — details in migrations)

customers (incl. address fields + `address_pushed_at`) · dogs (customer_id, subscription_id?,
quiz fields, selected_variants json, addons_products json, legacy_shopify_gid) · subscriptions
(status, frequency_months, next_charge_at, payment_state, original_order_id, draft_order_id,
attempt_count, next_retry_at, legacy_shopify_gid) · payment_methods (customer_id, gateway,
buyer_key encrypted, masked_card, is_active, source) · payment_ledger (idempotency_key unique,
statuses §3, amounts, payme_transaction_id, shopify_order_id, draft_order_id,
failure_code/message, raw_response_masked) · activity_events (append-only) · otp_codes (hashed)
· quiz_dogs · **products + product_variants (§1c)** · **mail_settings** (per-template
subject/body + **SMTP: use_custom_smtp, host, port, username, password `encrypted`, from_name,
from_address** — managed from the admin panel with a test-send action) ·
**shopify_connection** (single record: shop_domain, access_token `encrypted`, scopes,
installed_at, uninstalled_at) · app_settings · webhook_events (dedupe + raw payload).

**Address rule (Aviad decision #3):** the local DB owns the customer address; every address
write also **pushes to the Shopify customer default address** (compensating — Shopify failure
is logged and retried, never blocks the local write). `address_pushed_at` tracks sync.

Hot indexes: subscriptions `(status, next_charge_at)`; payment_ledger `(subscription_id,
created_at)`, `(status)`; products `(external_id)`.

## 8. Deployment (Railway)

One repo, three services + Postgres + Redis:
```
web:       php artisan serve (or FrankenPHP)  — HTTP only
worker:    php artisan queue:work --queue=charges,mail,sync
scheduler: php artisan schedule:work
```
Predeploy: `php artisan migrate --force`. No HTTP healthcheck on worker/scheduler.
Queues: `charges`, `mail`, `sync`. Env contract: `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`
(app credentials; the offline token lives encrypted in DB after OAuth install), `API_SECRET`,
`STOREFRONT_TOKEN_SECRET`, `PAYME_API_URL`, `PAYME_SELLER_ID`, `PAYME_HOSTED_FIELDS_API_KEY`,
`SMS_019_*` (later), `BILLING_KILL_SWITCH`. SMTP is NOT env — it is admin-managed in
`mail_settings` (env vars serve only as the bootstrap default mailer).

## 9. Cutover (summary; full plan in docs/REBUILD-PLAN.md)

Shadow parity vs v1 `last_me_payload` → delta import → freeze v1 writes → final delta →
swap theme `data-mills-api-base` (same secrets) → monitor 48h → v1 read-only. Rollback = swap
the URL back; v1 metaobjects are frozen at cutover, never deleted. Cutover checklist includes:
app installed via OAuth, webhooks registered, channel extension deployed and orders verified
to appear under the `mills-subscriptions` channel, product cache fresh, address push verified.

## 10. One-time setup Aviad performs (guided)

1. Create the app in the Shopify **Partner Dashboard** (custom distribution, single store) —
   yields `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`/`SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`.
2. Install it on the store via `/shopify/install` (OAuth).
3. `shopify app deploy` to publish the **mills-subscriptions Sales Channel extension**.
4. Enter SMTP details in Admin → Mail settings (test-send).
5. Provide 019 credentials when SMS phase begins.

## 11. Decision log

- 2026-06-24 — Project created as a separate app on the PayPlus-Subscriptions blueprint,
  multi-tenancy dropped; DB-first; endpoint contract frozen; OTP mints v1-format tokens. (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — SMTP managed from the admin panel (settings screen + test-send). (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — SMS provider is **019**; `SmsSender` interface now, adapter later. (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — Address changes push back to the Shopify customer (local DB owns; compensating
  push). (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — Subscription cancellation is ALWAYS immediate. (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — Shopify connection is a real Partner app (OAuth offline token, custom
  distribution) like RECHARGE — not a pasted admin token. (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — Product data + media cached locally (products/product_variants incl. image
  CDN URLs); hot paths never call Shopify live. (Aviad)
- 2026-06-24 — System-created orders must appear under the app's **Sales Channel** — channel
  extension (engine precedent) + `source_name == channel handle`; recurring billing switches
  from draft→complete to channel-attributed `orderCreate` with inline manual/external sale
  transaction; next-cycle draft kept only as the upcoming-order preview. (Aviad)
